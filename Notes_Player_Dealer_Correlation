I believe the player and dealer that are colluding to scam Lucky Duck are player Mylie Schmidt, and dealer Billy Jones.

During every single major loss at the Roulette table, Billy Jones was the dealer, and Mylie Schmidt was one of the players. This was found by isolating the times when major losses occurred, and checking who the dealer and players were. Doing so revealed the above, that those two were both present during every single major loss at the Roulette table. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that they are the ones colluding to take money from Lucky Duck.
